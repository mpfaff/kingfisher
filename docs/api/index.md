# API

Kingfisher provides a robust (WIP) API to scripts.

The full Javadoc is available [here]({{ 'javadoc' | relative_url }}), but most of the APIs in there are not intended to be used by scripts and are not exported to them.

## Registration

Scripts must register themselves to handle various events. See {{ 'javadoc/kingfisher/scripting/ScriptThread.RegistrationApi.html' | relative_url }} for a listing of these.

## Request handling

See {{ 'javadoc/kingfisher/requests/RequestScriptThread.Api.html' | relative_url }}.
